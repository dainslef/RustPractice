/**
 * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
 *
 * Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.
 * [
 *  [".Q..",  // Solution 1
 *   "...Q",
 *   "Q...",
 *   "..Q."],
 *
 *  ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
 *   "Q...",
 *   "...Q",
 *   ".Q.."]
 * ]
